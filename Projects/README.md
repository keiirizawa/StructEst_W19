## Project LaTeX template

I have included the following LaTeX files for your project and project presentation in this directory.

* a LaTeX project template, [`LaTeX_projtemplate.tex`](https://github.com/rickecon/StructEst_W19/blob/master/Projects/LaTeXtemplates/LaTeX_projtemplate.tex). This file will call a .bib file to use BibTeX references, and it will call the image in the `images` folder. I have included the compiled PDF file that results from the .tex, .bib, and image files.

* A LaTeX beamer slides template, [`LaTeX_slides`](https://github.com/rickecon/StructEst_W19/blob/master/Projects/LaTeXtemplates/LaTeX_slides.tex). You can use this to create your project proposal slides and your final presentation slides.
